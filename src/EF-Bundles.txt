EF Bunfles are:
-Executable files that can be used to apply migrations.
-Address some shortcoming of PMC (Package Manager Console) and CLI (Command Line Interface) commands.
--Can be run without needing additional tools or runtimes.
--Can be used as part of CI/CD deployment.
--Better error handling ensures that database changes succeded or fail toghether.
-Equivalent to running database update commands.


Create bundle command:
- (CLI) dotnet ef migrations bundle (--self-contained -r linux-x64)
- (PMC) Bundle-Migration (-SelfContained - TargetRuntime linux-x64)

.\efbundle.exe --connection 'Connection String'

If that EF already exists and we want a new migrations afer we generated the file:
use -force or --force to refenerate the efbungle with newer migrations.
